# network-cli

Command line interface (CLI) for accessing the Nexus Network. Highest-performance option for proving.

## Quick start

```
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/install.sh | sh
```

If you do not already have Rust, you will be prompted to install it.

## Terms of Use

Use of the CLI is subject to the [Terms of Use](https://nexus.xyz/terms_of_use).
The first time you run it, it prompts you to accept the terms. To accept the terms
noninteractively (for example, in a continuous integration environment),
add `NONINTERACTIVE=1` before `sh`.

## Known issues

Currently only proving is supported. Submitting programs to the network is in private beta.
