## The Nexus Network

The [Nexus Network](https://docs.nexus.xyz/network) is a global distributed prover 
network that unites the world's computers to power a new and better Internet: the 
Verifiable Internet.

There have been several testnets so far:
- Testnet 0: [October 08 – 28, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/nexus-launches-worlds-first-open-prover-network/)
- Testnet I: [December 9 – 13, 2024](https://blog.nexus.xyz/the-new-nexus-testnet-is-live/)
- Testnet II: [February 18 – 22, 2025](https://blog.nexus.xyz/testnet-ii-is-open/)

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Precompiled Binary (Recommended)

For the simplest and most reliable installation:

```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

This will:
1. Download and install the latest precompiled binary for your platform
2. Prompt you to accept the Terms of Use
3. Start the CLI in interactive mode

### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated installations (e.g., in CI):

```bash
curl -sSf https://cli.nexus.xyz/ -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
NONINTERACTIVE=1 ./install.sh
```

---

## Terms of Use

Use of the CLI is subject to the [Terms of Use](https://nexus.xyz/terms-of-use). 
First-time users running interactively will be prompted to accept these terms.

---

## Node ID

During the CLI's startup, you'll be asked for your node ID. To skip prompts in a
non-interactive environment, manually create a `~/.nexus/config.json` in the
following format:

```json
{
   "node_id": "<YOUR NODE ID>"
}
```

## Current Limitations
